# PAULA-S-CHOICE-WEB_PAGE
Firstly, we as a team would like to thank Masai School for providing us an opportunity to clone an ecommerce website in the given time period called construct week. I truly feel that this is a great opportunity where we all work in a team and because of this we get to know what a collaborative work looks like. And the best thing is that you gain confidence as you are also supposed to present this to the curriculum team.
So here we go…….

Introduction
We have made a clone of the website paula’s choice . This project has been made by the implementation of HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT which we have merged through GITHUB and the best thing about our page is that it is dynamic and responsive. This is basically a skin care website where you can purchase the best products suitable for your skin.

How we started….
We all were given 7 days to complete the project and for us it was totally a new experience to work on such an exciting and interesting project. So we all interacted with each other on what’s app and then we started doing meetings on zoom. To be honest it went very smooth in the beginning. We divided our work in parts and started the project with whole effort and dedication.
